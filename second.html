    <h1 id="underline4">Goals</h1>
    <br>
    <h2 id="underline5">Galvanize</h2>
    <p>My entire career history is with tech retail and customer service. I started coding as a hobby earlier this year and immediately knew this is what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I'm excited to be a part of Galvanize and jump starting my
        new career. My main goals through Galvanize are to establish the necessary tools and skills needed for a coding career and to meet people with similar interests and aspirations.</p>

    <h2 id="underline6">After Galvanize</h2>
    <p>I haven't singled out a particular employer that I'm dead set on but after looking at the alumni employer list on the Galvanize website I definitely have a few ideas. I used to work at the Apple corporate office as sales and customer service, but
        being able to return to the campus as a web developer would be amazing. IBM would also be pretty cool. I guess the company where I work isn't as important as the fact that I can make a career out of coding and be happy.</p>

    <h2 id="underline7">How I feel about starting with Galvanize?</h2>
